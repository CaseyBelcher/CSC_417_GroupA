Part 1 is worth 1 mark. 0.5 marks for getting 7/10 
of the following right. 1 mark for getting 10/10

1. Write a file prolog1c.txt that answers the following questions.

1a. In LISP what is an association list?

1b. What does the function `assoc` do:

      (assoc 'r '((a . b) (c . d) 
                  (r . x) (s . y) 
                  (r . z))) 

1c. What does the LISP 
[mapcan](http://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/mapcan.html)
function do?  Gove am example of its use.

1d. Give a small example of using LISP hash tables to (1) crete a
hash table then (2) write something into that hash table then (3)
read that value back.

1e What does the LISP "sublis" function do? Give
an example.

1f. In Prolog, what is the role of the bindings variable "binds".

1g. There seems to be a missing function. The examples shown below
use an `(= ?x ?x)` rule but there is no support code anywhere else
for `=`. So how does `(= ?x ?x)` work?

1h. What does "(gensym "?")" do?
1i. The following rules illustrates the need for variable renaming.
Why is such renaming required? What could go wrong (with the 
?x and ?y bindings) as our Prolog does inference over these two 
rules.
     (<- (child ?x ?y) (parent ?y ?x))
     (<- (daughter ?y ?x) (and (child ?y ?x) (female ?y)))
1j. (HARD) The code for "prove" that handles conjunctions seem wrong.  Why
does the "and" clause in "prove" use "reverse"? Write a comment in
the "ands" function that explains why we needed that reverse.
