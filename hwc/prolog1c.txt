Part 1 is worth 1 mark. 0.5 marks for getting 7/10 
of the following right. 1 mark for getting 10/10

1. Write a file prolog1c.txt that answers the following questions.

1a. In LISP what is an association list?
  A list consisting of key value pairs. 

1b. What does the function `assoc` do:

      (assoc 'r '((a . b) (c . d) 
                  (r . x) (s . y) 
                  (r . z))) 

   'assoc' is a way of looking up values in an association list using the key (first parameter) and the 
   list itself (second parameter), and it will return the first key match found. In this case, 'assoc' 
   returns (r . x) since that is the first key match for 'r. 
  
1c. What does the LISP 
[mapcan](http://jtra.cz/stuff/lisp/sclr/mapcan.html)
function do?  Gove am example of its use.
  
  mapcan applies a function (the first parameter) to each element of a list (the second parameter), 
  and concatenates the results of each of these function calls into a new list which is returned. 
  Example: (mapcan (lambda (x) (list(* 2 (+ x 1) ))) '(1 2 3)) => (4, 6, 8)
 

1d. Give a small example of using LISP hash tables to (1) crete a
hash table then (2) write something into that hash table then (3)
read that value back.

  (defparameter *mytable* (make-hash-table)) => create hash table 
  (setf (gethash 'whiskers *mytable*) 'cat) => stores the hash of 'whiskers to 'cat 
  (gethash 'whiskers *mytable*) => returns result of hashing 'whiskers  

1e What does the LISP "sublis" function do? Give
an example.
  "sublis" takes an association list (first parameter) and a tree (second parameter) - which is really just 
  another cons list - and returns a new tree which is the result of taking the original tree and replacing 
  each of the atoms with their values in the association list if the atom is a key for that association list 
  Example: (sublis '((t . turkey) ( b . beef ))
                   '(list 't 'b )) => (LIST 'TURKEY 'BEEF)

1f. In Prolog, what is the role of the bindings variable "binds".

    It is the value that binds the list of assoc and cdr's together. So the binds is a value to lookup elsewhere,
    and if come to a value without a "binds" you have found the item at the end. Binds is the car and the cdr is the 
    value it is binded to. 

1g. There seems to be a missing function. The examples shown below
use an `(= ?x ?x)` rule but there is no support code anywhere else
for `=`. So how does `(= ?x ?x)` work?
  
  (= ?x ?x) works because the fact is created in the hash table, where = is the consequence with no antecedent.
  So it is a fact that if two variables are the same they are equal. 

1h. What does "(gensym "?")" do?

  Creates a unique symbol guaranteed to not exist elsewhere in the
  system from the string "?". 
  
1i. The following rules illustrates the need for variable renaming.
Why is such renaming required? What could go wrong (with the 
?x and ?y bindings) as our Prolog does inference over these two 
rules.
     (<- (child ?x ?y) (parent ?y ?x))
     (<- (daughter ?y ?x) (and (child ?y ?x) (female ?y)))
     
     Variable renaming is required beacuse the evaluation of child in daughter would return false
     during inferernce by Prolog. Prolog would try to evaluate (child ?y ?x) (parent ?y ?x)) instead of 
     (child ?y ?x) (parent ?x ?y)). The bindings would clash during the recursive call of child in daughter.
     
1j. (HARD) The code for "prove" that handles conjunctions seem wrong.  Why
does the "and" clause in "prove" use "reverse"? Write a comment in
the "ands" function that explains why we needed that reverse.
